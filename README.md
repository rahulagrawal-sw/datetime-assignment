5)      In case of validation fails, print message invalid date time with input
6)      Prints the word equivalent of date and time
7)      Print the  day of the week for given input without using java api.
8)      This program will not use Java Calendar,  LocalDatetime and Day of week api .It can use java util date api for date creation only.
